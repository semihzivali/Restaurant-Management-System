Restaurant Management System
Welcome to the Restaurant Management System, a project developed using Java with Object-Oriented Programming principles. This system is designed to manage restaurant operations efficiently, including order management, role-based access control, and interaction with the kitchen.

Project Overview
This system provides functionalities for different roles within a restaurant, such as waiters, managers, and cashiers. The main features include:

Order Management: Waiters can take orders and send them to the kitchen.
Role-Based Access Control: Different roles (waiter, manager, cashier) have different levels of access.
Kitchen Order Management: Orders are displayed to the kitchen staff for preparation.
Database Integration: The system uses PostgreSQL to store order details, user roles, and menu information.
Features
1. User Authentication & Role Management
Role-based access control (RBAC) allows the system to assign different privileges to users based on their roles.
Waiters can place orders, cashiers handle payments, and managers have administrative privileges.
2. Order Management
Waiters can create new orders and view the status of existing orders.
The kitchen can track orders and mark them as completed.
Orders are linked to specific tables and users.
3. Menu Management
The system manages a menu with different categories (e.g., drinks, meals, desserts).
The manager can add, remove, or update menu items.
4. Database Integration
PostgreSQL is used to manage data for users, orders, and the menu.
A well-defined schema ensures efficient data storage and retrieval.

Setting Up PostgreSQL
Install PostgreSQL if you don’t have it installed.
Create a new database for the restaurant system.
Use the provided SQL scripts to set up the necessary tables and data structures.
Download the SQL script: Database Setup SQL
Running the Application
Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
Compile and run the project. Ensure that the PostgreSQL connection details are correctly configured in the application.properties or a similar configuration file.
Dependencies
Java 8+
PostgreSQL
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database interaction.
Usage
User Authentication:

Each user logs in with their credentials (username and password).
Depending on the role (waiter, cashier, manager), users will have access to different sections of the application.
Creating and Managing Orders:

Waiters can create new orders by selecting items from the menu.
The kitchen staff can track and mark orders as completed.
Menu Management:

The manager can update the menu, including adding and removing items or changing prices.
Future Enhancements
Integration with POS System: Implement POS system integration for more efficient order processing.
Reporting System: Add the ability for managers to generate sales reports and analyze performance.
